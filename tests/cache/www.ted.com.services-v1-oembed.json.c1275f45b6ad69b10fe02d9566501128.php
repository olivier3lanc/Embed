But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.","url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/george_monbiot_for_more_wonder_rewild_the_world","author_name":"George Monbiot","provider_name":"TED","provider_url":"https://www.ted.com","cache_age":300,"thumbnail_url":"https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/b4a648817c1a2102dc53dc2147bb1af2785067f0_1600x1200.jpg?h=316&w=560","thumbnail_width":560,"thumbnail_height":316,"author_url":"https://www.ted.com/speakers/george_monbiot","html":"<iframe src=\\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/george_monbiot_for_more_wonder_rewild_the_world\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"316\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>"}'
